There are a million chess front-ends, back-ends,
and component libraries out there, but I wanted
my own for fun.  In particular, I wanted to view
and share chess puzzles, as I enjoyed them in
**Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess**.

Note the two tabs -- the first has some sample hard coded puzzles.
The second allows you to create puzzles and send them/post them.
The entire puzzle definition is encoded into the URL string.

## Usage

```yarn install```
```yarn start```
