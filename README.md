# Chess Puzzles

There are a million chess front-ends, back-ends,
and component libraries out there, but I wanted
my own for fun.  In particular, I wanted to view
and share chess puzzles, as I enjoyed them in
**Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess**.

Note the tabs -- the first has some sample hard-coded puzzles.
The second allows you to create puzzles and send them/post them.
The entire puzzle definition is encoded into the URL string -- use
your *share* button to post them to text, email, or social media.  
Since the sharing is peer to peer, there's no need for any 
back-end or login.

## Usage

```yarn install```

```yarn start```
